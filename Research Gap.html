    <center><h1>Research Gap</h1></center><br><br><br>
    

<p>In Sri Lanka anyone has not ever created an IoT-based rainfall prediction system, according to previous research articles. They've merely constructed a rainfall forecasting system based on historical data. The goal of this research is to develop an IoT-based rainfall forecasting and monitoring system. Despite the fact that researchers throughout the world have created IoT-based rainfall prediction systems, these systems are not viable for Sri Lanka according to the climatic of the country characteristics and topography. We should really have a need of a sophisticated system, especially in a heavily populated area like Colombo since Sri Lankans have suffered floods.</p>

<p>Past weather data are collected from the Meteorological Department and from the Internet for this research, and after pre-processing, the rainfall is predicted using the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and Prophet Algorithm. The most accurate model is chosen from among these prediction models, and a prediction is made. Both LSTM Algorithm and Prophet models are faster and smoother. And, predicted weather data parameters that are Rainfall, Humidity, Temperature and Pressure and is visualized in a web application.</p>


<p>DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor, BMP/BME280 Barometric Pressure Sensor, and Water Level Sensor will be used to develop an IoT device with IoT sensors that collect real-time weather data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, and air pressure. The real-time data are displayed in a web application every 5 seconds.</p>

<p>When considering to the past research papers in Sri Lanka, most of researchers had done flood forecasting systems for the main basins in Sri Lanka. But some past researchers had researched the Food mitigation and flood risk measuring applications.</p>


<p>There is no comparable research project in Sri Lanka that compares to this one in terms of past research. All other programs collect data by processing past data, however, our approach is based on real-time IoT data. When we use foreign flood detection methods, they do not match our country's climate. As a result, we had to create a climate-control system for our country. The Colombo neighborhood was chosen for this project since it is frequently flooded throughout the city.</p>


<p>Typically, flood detection software findings are produced via dashboards or mobile applications. So, as part of this project, I've chosen to create an artificial intelligence chatbot to provide flood disaster information to end customers. I collect data from IoT devices for this chatbot. (AI), (NLP), and machine learning are all tools I use. I create the most accurate responses to end-user inquiries using these tools.</p>

<p>The first stage will be to conduct an online poll regarding floods in the 20-kilometer zone around Kaduwela. The information received from the survey will then be compiled. Then, based on the genuine challenges faced by flood victims, we divide this chatbot into three sections: before the catastrophe, during the disaster, and after the disaster. The end-user can access information before the flood stage in the preceding catastrophe part, such as rainfall dates and reports. During the catastrophe stage, users may access information regarding the crisis, such as flooded regions, safe zones, and emergency services. Following the catastrophe stage, the user will be provided with statistics on the last flood disaster The main focus of this research project is to get the data from IoT devices and give the predicted pieces of information from a chatbot application so here we consider three main functionalities to implement the chatbot. In this chart, there are main research gaps in (Research A-C) based on research papers and this Foodie.
</p>

<p>There is a need for a modern system for early detection and forecasting of flood situation along the Kelani River in Sri Lanka. The property damage caused by floods every year is huge. A more efficient and efficient system should be established here to minimize those damages. The specialty of our project is to use an Iot + machine learning system that is different from the flood level monitoring and forecasting systems that have been carried out along the Kelani River so far. Compared to other flood level detection and forecasting projects, this project has the potential to provide more accurate and up-to-date information in a shorter period of time. The system also has the ability to study subtle variations in current flood levels by location. The project is divided into four main sections, each of which focuses on four different areas. At present Sri Lanka does not have a system in place to provide the general public with up-to-date information on floods and the aim is to introduce such a system to the public.</p>

<p>Many past projects make predictions using past data, and since we study 10 years of data and make predictions, we can be more confident about accuracy. Modern technology has been used in the implementation of this system. AI provides more accurate forecasts, and the system is constantly updating. The general public's use of a system for early detection of any risk and current level of risk is minimal. Systems that provide accurate up-to-date data, especially in relation to their region, are minimal. This system continues to meet all those requirements.</p>

<p>According to previous studies, no one in Sri Lanka has ever constructed an IoT and map-based rainfall forecast system. Theyâ€™ve simply developed a rainfall forecasting algorithm based on historical data. My task is to create a flood prediction system based on maps. Despite the fact that map-based flood prediction systems have been developed all over the world, these techniques are not viable for Sri Lanka due to its meteorological features and topography. There are also differences in the maps. Floods occur in Sri Lanka every year, putting people in danger. For the people of Sri Lanka, this approach is essential for identifying and evacuating unsafe locations.</p>

<p>Typically, only dashboards or mobile applications are used to display the findings of flood detection initiatives. So, as part of this project, I've chosen to create a map that would provide end-users with information regarding flood disasters. I got data from IoT devices for this map. To illustrate locations, I utilized JavaScript, and the ARIMA model to forecast future disasters. I create the most accurate data for the end user utilizing these technologies.</p>

<p>We choose the Kaduwela location for this project since it is prone to flooding. The Irrigation Department's riverbank and contour line data were used in this investigation. It was gathered by me, and after preprocessing the data, I predicted the flood map. The map predicts submerged regions, identifies submerging areas, and unaffected places based on the growing water level and time of the river supplied to me. These are the outcomes of the prediction map when using it. Real-time data is collected for this, and the map is shown. Adjust the map so that it is updated on a regular basis. Finally, achieve a correct prediction rate of 90% or better. Create a website to represent this map as well. This stops the user from utilizing the website's map to navigate unsafe areas.</p>
