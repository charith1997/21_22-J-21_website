    <center><h1>Research Objectives</h1></center><br><br><br>
    

<p>The major objective of the research is to obtain real-time weather using IoT sensors and to use machine learning algorithms to forecast the rainfall and flooding. We want to leverage historical meteorological data as well as data from IoT devices to make predictions. By employing a Chatbot to create contour lines on a google map, taking flooding locations, and inform the public via a web application. An online application will also be used to monitor real-time weather data.Another major objective is to reduce the number of people killed or injured because of floods. Because floods do significant damage to property, human lives, and the country's economy.</p>

<p>My contribution to the research includes predicting rainfall as a primary goal. To forecast rainfall, temperature, humidity and the pressure, a heavily inhabited and regularly flooding areas around the SLIIT campus Malabe, including the Kelani River, will be considered a 10km zone. Machine learning algorithms such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm and Prophet model are used to forecast rainfall.The other goal is to obtain real-time weather information from IoT sensors. I'm hoping to collect real-time data every five minutes. Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, and Rainfall will be used as parameters in this study. The web application will display the real-time data after it has been obtained.</p>


<p>People nowadays are so preoccupied with their day-to-day tasks that they haven’t enough time to watch the news or read newspapers. Live weather data and forecasted rainfall will be monitored in a web application as a solution. As a result, by enrolling for the web application, consumers will be able to obtain all-weather information. Users who have registered will receive reminders when they are in flood-prone areas.</p>

<p>People cannot afford to wait for late information such as news and announcements in today's fast-paced environment. As a result, in emergencies such as natural disasters, people want a quick information system. Our primary goal is to provide end-users with tools that are quick, dependable, and easy to use. So, for our early flood warning system, I'm planning to build a chatbot driven by artificial intelligence that is easy to use. as a result of which end customers may acquire flood catastrophe information by speaking with an AI assistant Reduce the disaster's impact by telling users as soon as feasible. The information supplied by chatbots allows victims to access real-time weather updates and disaster statistics. As a consequence, victims might be better prepared for the disaster.They will then be able to mitigate the damage. Through the after-disaster area, victims may share their disaster experiences on social media, and the chatbot gives disaster statistics reports so that end-users can learn about the disaster summary and share it on social media to aid other victims.</p>


<p>Victims can get in touch with authorities by dialing the chatbot under the in-disaster section. so that victims can simply obtain the assistance they require The call can be sent to the police, the fire bridge, or other emergency services. Create an easy-to-use interface.</p>

• Obtaining real-time data from IoT devices <br>
• Obtaining data from existing server <br>
• Recognizing end-user issues <br>
• To create a web application <br>




<p>There is a need for a modern system for early detection and forecasting of flood situation along the Kelani River in Sri Lanka. The property damage caused by floods every year is huge. A more efficient and efficient system should be established here to minimize those damages. The specialty of our project is to use an Iot + machine learning system that is different from the flood level monitoring and forecasting systems that have been carried out along the Kelani River so far. Compared to other flood level detection and forecasting projects, this project has the potential to provide more accurate and up-to-date information in a shorter period of time. The system also has the ability to study subtle variations in current flood levels by location. The project is divided into four main sections, each of which focuses on four different areas. At present Sri Lanka does not have a system in place to provide the general public with up-to-date information on floods and the aim is to introduce such a system to the public. </p>

<p>Many past projects make predictions using past data, and since we study 10 years of data and make predictions, we can be more confident about accuracy. Modern technology has been used in the implementation of this system. AI provides more accurate forecasts, and the system is constantly updating. The general public's use of a system for early detection of any risk and current level of risk is minimal. Systems that provide accurate up-to-date data, especially in relation to their region, are minimal. This system continues to meet all those requirements.</p>

<p>People do not yet have a mechanism in place for receiving frequent flood updates. Due to their hectic schedule, they also find it difficult to watch the news. They may quickly get flood information at any moment using our system. Flood-prone locations are also notified by the system[9].</p>

<p>By providing users with real-time information, you can lessen the impact of the calamity. Based on the information gathered from the flood map. As a consequence, disaster victims will be prepared. They'll be able to limit the harm then. End-users may grasp the event's summary and share it with victims using the map's disaster statics reports in the post-disaster area.</p>

<p>A ARIMA model designed by me for forcasting future disasters Then it helps in displaying locations that foretell future calamities.Following a predicted future disaster, the map displays submerged regions, flooding areas, and safe areas using different colors. The highlighted locations in the map were made using javascript. In the map, you'll find the following items.</p>

1. Location name <br>
2. Submerged areas  (red color) <br>
3. Flooding areas (orange color) <br>
4. Safe areas  ( gereen color) <br>
