<p>Among the worldâ€™s natural disasters, Floods are dangerous natural disaster. As this disaster, so many human lives and properties are damaged. Floods are destroyed human lives almost every year. For example, the below table shows the countries with the highest number of casualties in 2022 to date and the number of human lives.</p>

<p>Floods occur practically every year in Sri Lanka. Floods wreak havoc on both people and property. As a result, the government will be forced to spend a significant amount of money in order to restore the afflicted area. Heavy rains are the primary cause of flooding. Every year, monsoon rains deluge Sri Lanka, wreaking havoc on people's lives.</p>


<p>There is not a proper early rainfall forecasting and monitoring system in Sri Lanka as Sri Lanka is still developing country. There is still a manual forecasting and warning system in place, rather than a computer-based one. As a result, the country's economy, as well as human beings, the environment, and property, are all negatively affected by the excessive rain.</p>

<p>Despite the existence of old research papers on rainfall prediction systems, Sri Lanka lacks a proper rainfall warning system. They have projected rains and floods in Sri Lanka based on rivers, but there is no appropriate warning mechanism in place. Sri Lanka should have a need of such a smart forecast system, primarily in a heavily populated area as Colombo, as people have experienced with heavy rainfall and floods. Despite the fact that Sri Lanka has a Meteorology Department, we are now unable to obtain live weather data as Sri Lankans as the Department of Meteorology only publishes data once a day.</p>


<p>Due to its multiple nature, the task of warning communities of imminent disasters soon becomes complex. The difficulty boils down to predicting the catastrophe, communicating that prognosis to the appropriate authorities, notifying the impacted communities, and evacuating. those groups of people Each of the steps provided is subdivided into its section. a collection of goals and challenges that will be discussed further down. As a clarification, the seven thoughts section addresses the system in general This does not apply to the abstract definition of technology that is usually utilized. This does not stop anyone from completing any of these duties, though. Since some early warning systems exist, Section II outlines them. a collection of policies that do not rely on technology.</p>


<p>To begin, the early warning system must foresee the catastrophe rather than simply detect it, as this would not allow enough time to evacuate. When a river floods, the water level rises. In only a few hours, you can cruise down a major river like ours. allowing only enough time for authorities to be notified, much less The system must foresee the flood to evacuate the neighborhoods. many hours ahead of time.</p>

<p>a grasp of the event's impact, a history of the event's course, and an understanding of the risks involved In the event of floods, this can be quantified as follows: Knowing the river level is useless, but knowing which river to avoid is. How long will such locations be flooded as a result of the river level? before flooding, and the likelihood of flooding occurring at That stage gives you the data you need to make a decision.
</p>

<p>None of this addresses the reality that the system operates in a real-world setting and must endure it. Some of the physical measuring components are accessible to the environment and must withstand theft. and damage, as well as run with minimal upkeep. A specific percentage of the components will need to be covered. The geographic area in which the event takes place, which is typically quite large. area, to accurately measure a sufficient number of data points for the prototype The budget normally dictates that this be kept to a bare minimum. A number Severalllowed, necessitating careful arrangement and producing huge communication distances for data aggregation point of calculation (or points).</p>

<p>All of this necessitates policy to describe the more abstract issues that arise. How far ahead of time should the system forecast? What is the uncertainty margin Is it acceptable to make a prediction? Who needs to be notified, and when? What is your top priority? And so on for nearly every facet of the business. system. Because these systems frequently span state or county lines, Defining departmental boundaries and delegating responsibilities for addressing questions the issues, let alone putting the remedies into practice in some cases Dealing with multiple levels of bureaucracy is a must in many circumstances.</p>

<p>There is a need for a modern system for early detection and forecasting of flood situation along the Kelani River in Sri Lanka. The property damage caused by floods every year is huge. A more efficient and efficient system should be established here to minimize those damages. The specialty of our project is to use an Iot + machine learning system that is different from the flood level monitoring and forecasting systems that have been carried out along the Kelani River so far. Compared to other flood level detection and forecasting projects, this project has the potential to provide more accurate and up-to-date information in a shorter period of time. The system also has the ability to study subtle variations in current flood levels by location. The project is divided into four main sections, each of which focuses on four different areas. At present Sri Lanka does not have a system in place to provide the general public with up-to-date information on floods and the aim is to introduce such a system to the public.</p>

<p>Many past projects make predictions using past data, and since we study 10 years of data and make predictions, we can be more confident about accuracy. Modern technology has been used in the implementation of this system. AI provides more accurate forecasts, and the system is constantly updating. The general public's use of a system for early detection of any risk and current level of risk is minimal. Systems that provide accurate up-to-date data, especially in relation to their region, are minimal. This system continues to meet all those requirements.</p>

<p>El Nio is causing global floods as a result of climate change. This is also true in Sri Lanka. Human activities are also to responsible for floods in the lowlands (building construction, factories, roads). Soil erosion is an issue in the upper levels of the river due to the direct passage of rains. Floods are the most damaging natural disaster in today's Sri Lanka. Floods wreak havoc on our country every year. As a result, the government will be forced to spend a large amount of money to recover from the flood disaster. If Sri Lanka has a computerized, accurate early flood warning system, damage can be easily reduced.</p>

<p>Many research discoveries for flood management and early warning systems have been made in Sri Lanka. According to a map, a map has not yet been put in place to show future warnings and the scope of the damage. Currently, there is no infrastructure in place in Sri Lanka to show Realtime flooding on a map. In this situation, some Sri Lankans are struggling with far too many issues. As a result, human life and property loss are common throughout the year in Sri Lanka. Traffic congestion and family displacement occur since the individuals were unknown before to the flood. For the people of Sri Lanka, this approach is essential for identifying and evacuating unsafe locations.</p>

<p>Using this map, a user can get a prediction about warning areas. As an example, if someone wants to go to a flood-affected area, he or she may not know that the area is submerged or flooding. Then users can use this application to get an idea of the location to which they want to go. Actually, this map also helps people who are suffering from the flood. The user can go to a safe area using this application. On this map, a safe area is highlighted using green. Actually, this map must be very user-friendly because, at that time, the user will be stressed. Therefore the user experience must be minimalistic.</p>

<p>What is the maximum amount of time that the system should forecast? What is the level of uncertainty? Is it appropriate to make an educated guess? When and who should be notified? What is the most important thing to you? And so on for almost every aspect of the company. system. Due to the fact that these networks commonly cross state or county boundaries, Determining departmental boundaries and distributing responsibility for resolving concerns, much alone putting cures into effect in some situations, are difficult tasks. In many situations, dealing with numerous levels of bureaucracy is necessary.</p>
