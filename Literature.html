<p>In Sri Lanka, the Artificial Neural Network technique works well for forecasting monsoon rainfall. The climatic indicators ENSO, EQUINOO, and OLTC were used as predictor variables to anticipate monthly and seasonal rainfall. In certain aspects, the actual monthly rainfall and the forecasted rainfall from Artificial Neural Network models were different. A relatively simple ANN design was utilized, and the ANN was trained using a back propagation strategy, which may not have delivered the best result. Minor weights that may not have offered the best design were eliminated from Artificial Neural Network architectures instead of acquiring them for various months.</p>
IoT plays a special role in identifying special disasters and educating the public about disasters. Iot also paves the way for the Smart City concept. Iot hardware and software is unique in itself. Iot is the best solution for cloud-based solutions and is easy to operate based on our experience.This structure is a solar-powered pre-flood warning system. Flood risk detection uses a water level sensor. The data obtained by the sensors is transmitted by the GPRS convention. The focus of the observations will be on data collection, research and setting up of a flood alert service in the affected areas. A web application and a mobile application are created to display the water level, and provide continuous activity and forecast information to users of this service.The system collects sensitive data from a Raspberry pi controller and uses wifi to quickly send the received data to a specific location. A notification service can quickly monitor flooding and provide real-time data to users quickly. Data is sent to a specific control center, which analyzes the flooding and communicates to the user via a chatbot.<br><br>

Several classification processes for forecast data are used in the approach for identifying, assessing, and mapping flood-affected regions. The suggested flood monitoring system, which is based on a flood prediction system, is capable of automatically producing data on flood rise and flood forecasting. This model exhibited 90 percent accuracy while using real-time data to assess the flooded area's susceptibility map. As a consequence, this map may be used to estimate the flooded areas' susceptibility. At a modest cost, the approach may be deployed rapidly and easily to sites with little map data. With such 1D-2D models, the precision and resolution of the 2D surface model is a challenge. Indeed, the resolution of the input data, i.e., topographic data resolution, has a considerable influence on the 2D model's validity. The resolution of the 2D model must therefore be suitable for an accurate depiction of the city.</p>
